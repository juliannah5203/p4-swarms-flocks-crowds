Title: Falling World
## Explanation of Target Behaviors
I got my inspiration from a game I played in the past, even though I don't remember the name of the game anymore, but the game is basically about that all little characters will start by falling into the hole as they gather around the hole, and the scene will become the world after all little characters fall in and gather again. The first target behavior (Avoidance) for my boids is that boids will avoid the touch with the pipe on the screen which is connected to the hole. The second target behavior (Attraction) is that boids will fall into the hole and no longer able to move.
## Description
On the deployment website, there is a canvas showing a black background with a pipe and a hole. Little avatars, representing boys and girls in the real world, start to show up from four corners of the canvas, and moves around as a group on the canvas. Below the canvas, an instruction text is prompting players to drag the mouse in order to generate more new boids.
## Artistic Statement
I am trying to simulate the scene of the game with flocks, boids will gather up and fall into the hole. Inside the canvas, the pipe is just here to represent the existence of the hole, so the pipe will be treated as walls so all avatars will stay away from it. I use attraction to achieve the gather of those nearby avatars and use avoidance to inform players about the existence of the hole. I use two different drawings for two types of avatars, blue and pink representing boys and girls in the real world, I also add a hole and pipe with white and grey color to distinguish them from the background, representing the walls / traps (which should be avoid).
